## NavBar with ARIA Attributes

### ARIA attributes enable modifying an element's states and properties as defined in the accessibility tree. 
#### Note: ARIA only modifies the accessibility tree, modifying how assistive technology presents the content to your users. ARIA doesn't change anything about an element's function or behavior.
